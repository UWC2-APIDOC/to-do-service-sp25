#  To-Do Service API Overview
The To-Do Service API is a RESTful interface that allows you to manage a cloud-hosted to-do list. It enables developers to create, update, retrieve, and delete tasks programmatically, as well as manage user accounts and send reminders.

This mock API simulates the behavior of a real-world task management service, making it ideal for development, testing, or demonstration purposes.
